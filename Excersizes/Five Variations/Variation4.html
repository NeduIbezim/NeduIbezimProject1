            Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

            With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
            
            Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
            
            A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
            
            Is the imprisoned  lightning, and her name
            
            Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
            
            Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
            
            The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
            
            “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she
            
            With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,
            
            Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
            
            The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
            
            Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
            
            I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
