        <h1>Week B</h1>
        <div class="relative">        
        <p style="color:rgb(82, 40, 40);"> Over the past week, I've been learning more about CSS and it's applications. In my opinion, it was a little daunting at first but I think I'm beginning to pick up more and more of it. What caught my attention more this week was the interface discussion that was given by Anna and Tony. One thing it made me realize is how far we've come when it comes to interfaces on the internet from its creation to now. When you compare what the interface looked like back when it was created versus the interface we have nowadays, you realize that all this happened in a relatively short amount of time. Some would argue that it's not such a short amount of time considering it's been about 40 years since the internet became accessible to all in 1983, although I would argue otherwise considering. Like the Industrial Revolution lasted twice as long and yet there weren't as many drastic changes. So that will always come off as mind-boggling to me, like how computers used to be a lot larger by the time I was born compared to now. In a way, you could say that I and many others have grown up alongside the internet.

            I'm not sure what else to talk about so I'm just going to start rambling about space. One thing that I think is pretty amazing to think about is that while there are trillions upon trillions of stars, galaxies, planets, and other deep space objects the chance that any large body would collide with our planet or any of the other planets or the Sun is astronomically small which implies that there's just that much space in between all these large bodies. Although this doesn't mean that we're safe from any danger we still can be affected by the gravitational pull of large objects such as stars and other stuff, a passing star could even throw some asteroids our way though I doubt a lot of them would make it to Earth considering we are kind of protected a bit by the massive gas giants orbiting around our solar system. Another thing that I just kind of think about is the question of what our galaxy looks like, now that question would come off as redundant considering there are plenty of pictures out there on the internet and on official websites of what our galaxy looks like when in reality we don't 100% know what our galaxy actually looks like considering the farthest man-made object Voyager 1 and 2 has just reached the edge of the Oort cloud which is a bubble that envelopes the solar system that is also a storage for many smaller icy rocks. I'm not sure how to compare this but to achieve any kind of bird's eye view of the solar system Voyager one and two would have to travel astronomically far in order to even come close to getting that, and even then I don't believe we have enough power for any man-made object to last that kind of trip. The only thing we were able to do to produce the picture that we have now is through the use of several different telescopes on the ground and in space to take a picture of the disc of the Milky Way as we see it on Earth. So I think that's pretty cool.
