        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> So for this weekly blog I'd like to talk about what we've been doing in class so far. So for a project one I found that it was a lot more challenging than I realized but in a different way than most other classes if that makes sense. To describe it, if you know the saying something hitting you from Left Field I describe a lot of my classes hitting me from left field while in the case of this project I somehow was hit from below me through the ground. One thing that was difficult for me is that I had a hard time trying to place objects in places of the screen that I wanted them to be in. Overall I did find it fun to explore the different functions that I haven't really dove into in previous assignments. Now they were moving on to JavaScript I'm excited to see what more I could add to my website.

It being the existence of galaxies in the universe. For some context when you look at the physics as a whole relating to galaxies you find out that galaxies technically shouldn't exist. The only reason that Earth and all the other planets are orbiting around the Sun is because the Sun accounts for about 99.98% of all the mass in the solar system which explains why all the planets in our solar system orbits around the sun it's just that much more massive than all of the planets combined. While on the other hand when you look at the Galaxy as a whole the Galaxy orbits around Sagittarius A, a supermassive black hole at the center. That black hole accounts for about 0.0001% of all the available mass in the galaxy. So by that logic none of the stars or solar systems in the Galaxy are actually gravitationally bound to that black hole yet it all orbits around that black hole. When I asked my astronomy professor about this he explained it as the Galaxy itself is pulling on itself causing it to keep its shape and spin like how a solar system ahead of us could be pulling on us as we are pulling on another solar system behind us or at least that's how I understand it. Although I do have a Theory on why our galaxy is the way it is, keep in mind I am not a physicist at all. This little ramble session is starting to get a little long so I'll talk more about it in the next weekly. I'm excited to give my little Half Baked response to the formation of galaxies. I always like to theorize about these things even if I'm not smart enough to study the physics behind them.
