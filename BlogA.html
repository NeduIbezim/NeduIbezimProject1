        <h1>Week A</h1>
        <p>Over the past week, I've been learning more about Html and CSS. While HTML was pretty easy  for me to pick up as I have used it in the past and in another class I’m currently taking CSS was different. I have never really used CSS before so it was a little hard for me to get down at first but I think I’m beginning to get it. The way that CSS and HTML interact with each other reminds me of this one game development program that I've used but instead, the interaction was between a script of code and something called a module script in which the script would pull things from. I also like how I'm getting more and more used to visual studio code, before this class I have used Visual Studio code a number of times although it was usually to view or edit a file of code. I never really ran code through Visual Studio code and honestly, I didn't really think you could. The same goes for GitHub, up until this class I have only used GitHub as an alternative way to download files from other people and never really looked too into it.  I hope to learn more about front-end coding in this class because it's something that I've been wanting to explore but never really knew how to approach. I've mostly been doing a lot of backend coding with a lot of my classes and personal projects.

            I'd like to talk about how my week is going so far in this blog. So far it's going pretty well. I had to submit a lot of math assignments over the past few days and I was able to explore a club or two that I have come across during the involvement Fair. One of which I have gotten to put on Armor and participate in a duel which was fun but also scary as the sounds of the wooden swords hitting my opponent always made me think I seriously hurt them. Since this is my first year on Main Campus, exploring the campus was a little overwhelming and still is to a point since there are a lot of places to go on campus whether it be class buildings, dorms, or restaurants. It's also been fun meeting and talking to a lot of the students and staff here. I've found it especially interesting talking with people who are taking the same major as me as I tend to find out that we have a lot of the same experiences whether it be related to our major or just life in general. Coming from the Newark campus, Main campus is a lot more lively and vibrant with a lot more places to go and events to attend. Although one thing that I do miss on the Newark campus that main campus doesn't have much of is the sense of closeness that it has as they were fewer buildings closer together with a lot fewer students walking around.
