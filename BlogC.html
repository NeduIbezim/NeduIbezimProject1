        <p style="color:rgb(53, 82, 40); font-weight: bold;"> This week's discussion was intriguing as all the others. If I remember correctly there was one point in the presentation/ discussion where we talked about aliases online and that really made me think about my own presents on the internet because I, like many other people, use an alias when I am online on social media, video games, and other places. What's interesting is that there have been a few instances where I have used an alias for my alias. Also to talk about the exercises that we did I had a lot of fun doing them. It was fun to go through the different styles and variations with the five variations exercise and I especially liked the very simple box styles that they had. As with the hypertext exercise, it was fun creating different pages that linked to each other, with mine I didn't have much of a direction with it however I do enjoy creating stories from time to time so I think mine drifted more towards a story with no real clear ending. I initially wanted to create more branches in the choices that you make with a little more dialogue however I didn't have the time to really build that, I also realized how intricate I would have to make not only the pages but the choices as well.

So I'm going to just go on another rant about astronomy. I'm not sure if this Theory or question has already been answered or solved but I've been wondering. Everybody knows that the Earth isn't all solid, under our surface are the mantle outer core, and inner core with a lot of liquid Metals moving in a interesting motion affected by the Earth's magnetic field. What I'm wondering though is about Mars's magnetic field. Mars's magnetic field is a lot weaker than Earth's and something that's interesting is that if a planet's magnetic field is weakened then it's susceptible to the solar wind from the sun which would strip away the atmosphere of said planets among other materials. So as long as the magnetic field is active then the planet's atmosphere is protected and if you aren't aware the magnetic fields on terrestrial planets are produced via their liquid magma and core under their surfaces. They create this magnetic field by moving around and rubbing against each other which causes electromagnetism stuff to happen and results in a magnetic field. This brings me to what I've been wondering, Mars has a more solid inside compared to the earth and as a result, has a weakened magnetic field. I'm wondering if Olympus Mons has something to do with it. Olympus Mons is the largest volcano in the solar system so much so that it curves with the planet. So what if back then when Mars had a more active inside the pressure building up from its activity resulted in the formation of Olympus Mons while also disrupting and damaging the magnetic field protecting the planet? I doubt a simple volcano formation could cool down a planet's inside and disrupt its magnetic field as we have countless volcanoes on Earth however a large volcano constantly erupting in the same spot and ejecting massive amounts of material is bound to do otherwise. Although that's just food for thought I haven't done a lot of research into this.
